# PrApp

**TODOs**

* Create database tables for all possible entry types
* Load database into calendar in 3 cases:
  1. On creation of activity
  2. On month change
  3. On addition/deletion of database entries
* Show entries in calendar
* Create medication entries automatically for a planned an encounter
  (default answer to "Medication taken": no)
* Delete entries in calendar
* Check for "obligatory/optional" on entry
* Check if activity is already in activity stack on close to avoid endless amount of open activities
* (optional) Change "yes/no" in PrEP-screen to swipe
